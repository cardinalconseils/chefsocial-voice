### Stripe Integration
```javascript
// Customer Creation
const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
  email: userEmail,
  name: userName,
  metadata: { restaurant_name: restaurantName }
});

// Subscription Management
const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
  customer: customer.id,
  items: [{ price: 'price_monthly_79' }],
  trial_period_days: 14
});
```

### License Management Logic
```javascript
// Trial Extension
if (user.subscriptionStatus === 'trialing') {
  const currentTrialEnd = new Date(user.trialEndDate);
  currentTrialEnd.setDate(currentTrialEnd.getDate() + 7);
  user.trialEndDate = currentTrialEnd.toISOString();
}

// Subscription Status Updates
user.subscriptionStatus = 'active'; // or 'cancelled', 'past_due'
```
