Voice, Positioning & Content Rules for Culinary Social Media AI

## üéØ POSITIONING FRAMEWORK (April Dunford Approach)

### Core Positioning Statement
**We are:** AI-powered culinary content creators  
**For:** Chefs, restaurants, and food entrepreneurs (1-20 locations)  
**Who:** Want professional social media without the time investment  
**Unlike:** Generic social media tools, expensive agencies, or doing it manually  
**We provide:** Voice-driven AI that transforms culinary passion into viral content automatically

### Key Differentiators
- **Voice-first creation** - Talk your way to viral content
- **Food industry specialized** - AI trained on culinary culture and trends
- **Multilingual vibe marketing** - Captures authentic restaurant personality across languages
- **Instant platform optimization** - One voice command, multiple platform posts
- **Chef-to-customer storytelling** - Transforms kitchen passion into customer engagement

## ‚úçÔ∏è COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES (Harry Dry + Dave Gerhardt Fusion)

### Voice Characteristics
- **Passionate but practical** - "Your dishes deserve the spotlight they've earned"
- **Direct but warm** - "Fini le stress des r√©seaux sociaux" not "We eliminate social media complexity"
- **Food-savvy but accessible** - Use culinary terms naturally, explain AI simply
- **Personal but professional** - "Votre passion" instead of "notre technologie"

### Forbidden Words/Phrases
‚ùå "AI solutions"  
‚ùå "Digital transformation"  
‚ùå "Content optimization"  
‚ùå "Social media management"  
‚ùå "Engagement strategies"  
‚ùå "Best-in-class"  
‚ùå "Cutting-edge technology"

### Preferred Language Patterns
‚úÖ "Votre passion devient virale" instead of "Our AI optimizes engagement"  
‚úÖ "Parlez, on publie" instead of "Voice-activated content creation"  
‚úÖ "√áa marche tout seul" instead of "Seamless automation"  
‚úÖ "Vos plats m√©ritent mieux" instead of "Optimize your food photography"

## üé® CONTENT STRUCTURE RULES

### Headlines (Inspired by Harry Dry)
- **Maximum 6 words when possible**
- **Use concrete culinary outcomes**: "3 posts per dish" not "More content"
- **Lead with chef benefits**: "Cook while we post" not "AI-powered posting"
- **Question format for pain points**: "Pourquoi vos plats restent invisibles?"

### Body Copy (Dave Gerhardt Tone)
- **Short sentences. Like cooking instructions.**
- **One idea per paragraph**
- **Use "vous" and "votre" extensively**
- **End sections with clear next steps**
- **Culinary metaphors**: "Marinated in engagement data"

### Pain Points Framework
- **Validate chef struggles**: "The problem isn't your food"
- **Use kitchen scenarios**: "Perfect risotto, 12 likes. Fast food chain, 12K likes."
- **Time-specific pain**: "20 hours/week on photos, 2 minutes eating"
- **Emotional recognition**: "Your passion deserves better reach"

## üåê BILINGUAL GUIDELINES

### French Voice (Primary Quebec Market)
- **Use "on" not "nous"** - More chef-to-chef conversation
- **Quebec culinary expressions**: "C'est de la job" instead of "C'est du travail"
- **Regional food culture**: Reference poutine, tourti√®re, sugar shacks naturally
- **Warm but direct tone** - Like talking to your sous chef

### English Voice (ROC/US Market)
- **Slightly more polished** - Professional kitchen energy
- **Avoid Quebec anglicisms**
- **Food truck to fine dining inclusive**
- **Maintain culinary authenticity**

## üìù CONTENT TEMPLATES

### Homepage Hero Formula
**[CULINARY ACTION] + [VIRAL OUTCOME] + [TIME FRAME]**  
"Cook your signature dish. We make it viral. In minutes."

**[CHEF REALITY] + [AI MAGIC]**  
"You create in the kitchen. We create the buzz."

### Pain Point Formula
**[KITCHEN SCENARIO] + [SOCIAL MEDIA FAIL] + [EMOTIONAL IMPACT]**  
"Perfect beef wellington. Posted at 2pm. 8 likes. Your heart sinks."

### Value Proposition Formula
**[CHEF FOCUS] + [AI HANDLES] + [BUSINESS RESULT]**  
"You perfect recipes. We perfect posts. Customers come hungry."

### Call-to-Action Formula
**[IMMEDIATE KITCHEN ACTION] + [VIRAL RESULT]**  
"Upload tonight's special. Watch it trend tomorrow."

## üö´ CONTENT DON'TS

### Avoid These Patterns
- Generic social media speak
- Technical AI specifications  
- Vague promises ("increase engagement")
- Non-food industry examples
- Corporate marketing jargon
- Passive voice ("content is optimized")

### Never Say
"We help restaurants..." ‚Üí Say: "Votre cuisine devient virale..."  
"Our platform enables..." ‚Üí Say: "Vous cuisinez, on publie..."  
"Advanced AI technology..." ‚Üí Say: "Intelligence qui comprend la bouffe..."  
"Social media optimization..." ‚Üí Say: "Posts qui font saliver..."

## ‚úÖ CONTENT DOs

### Always Include
- **Specific time savings** - "2 minutes per post"
- **Culinary scenarios** - "While plating the evening rush"
- **Food-specific benefits** - "Hashtags qui font commander"
- **Clear chef actions** - Every section ends with kitchen-relevant next steps
- **Passion ownership** - "Your culinary story" not "our content system"

### Power Phrases (French)
- **"Votre passion m√©rite d'√™tre vue"** (Your passion deserves to be seen)
- **"√áa marche pendant que vous cuisinez"** (It works while you cook)
- **"Parlez, on s'occupe du reste"** (Speak, we handle the rest)
- **"Fini le stress des r√©seaux sociaux"** (No more social media stress)
- **"Vos plats deviennent viraux"** (Your dishes go viral)

### Power Phrases (English)
- **"Your dishes deserve the spotlight"**
- **"Cook while we post"**
- **"Speak your passion, we spread it"**
- **"No more social media overwhelm"**
- **"From kitchen to viral"**

## üìä MEASUREMENT & TESTING

### Copy Performance Indicators

- **Passion resonance** (does it honor their craft?)
- **Time-to-value communication** (understand benefits quickly?)

### A/B Testing Priorities
- **Passion vs. efficiency headlines**

- **The culinary storyteller** - We amplify chef passion
- **The kitchen companion** - We work alongside, not above

- **The generic tool** - We're built for food, not everything
- **The replacement** - We enhance chef creativity, don't replace it

- **The corporate solution** - We're chef-to-chef authentic

## üçΩÔ∏è CULINARY-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### Food Photography Language
- **"Capture the steam"** not "High-quality images"
- **"Frame the golden crust"** not "Visual optimization"
- **"Show the sauce drip"** not "Dynamic composition"

### Voice AI Positioning
- **"Describe the sizzle"** not "Voice input processing"
- **"Tell your story while you plate"** not "Hands-free content creation"

### Restaurant Industry Pain Points
- **"Too busy to post during service"**

- **"Competitors with worse food, better posts"**
- **"Spending more time on phones than in kitchen"**

## üìã CONTENT CHECKLIST

Before publishing any copy, verify:

### Culinary Authenticity Check
‚òê Would a chef immediately understand this?  
‚òê Does it respect the craft of cooking?  
‚òê Is it specific to food industry challenges?  
‚òê Does it sound like chef-to-chef conversation?

### Voice Check
‚òê Passionate about food, not pushy about tech  
‚òê Direct about benefits, warm about relationship  
‚òê Confident about results, humble about role  
‚òê Local without being exclusive

‚òê One culinary idea per paragraph  
‚òê Clear kitchen-relevant next step  
‚òê Specific food examples and scenarios  
‚òê No generic business buzzwords

‚òê Would a busy chef understand during prep time?  
‚òê Does it solve real kitchen-to-customer problems?  
‚òê Is the outcome clear and food-relevant?  
‚òê Does it feel authentic, not AI-generated?
