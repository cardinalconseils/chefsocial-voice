# ChefSocial Pricing - One Bundle, Everything Included

## 🍽️ **Finally, Restaurant Software That Makes Sense**

**Stop paying for 5 different tools.** Stop getting nickeled and dimed for basic features. Stop choosing between "starter" and "professional" plans that don't include what you actually need.

**One bundle. Everything included. Fair usage limits. Pay only when you actually exceed them.**
