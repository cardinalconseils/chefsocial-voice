   - Quality checks performed on generated content

3. **Approval Workflow**
   - Generated content sent via SMS
   - User reviews and responds with commands
   - System processes approval/rejection
   - Content published or revised based on feedback

4. **System Integration**
   - Content stored in user library
   - Analytics tracked for optimization
   - Usage metrics monitored
   - Performance data collected

5. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Connection issues managed gracefully
   - Failed generations retried automatically
   - User notified of processing status
   - Fallback options available when needed
